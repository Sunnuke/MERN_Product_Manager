# MERN_Product_Manager
For this project I will be practicing the creation of a full-stack MERN app. The concept will be a basic product manager that a user can use to add a list of products, they may also view the list of all the items they have added, also the user can view a selected item where the items attributes would be displayed, also edit items, and delete items as well.
